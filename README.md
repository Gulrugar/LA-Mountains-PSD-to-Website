[Visit the LA Mountains website =>](https://la-mountains.netlify.app/ "LA Mountains")

## Description

This is a single page website created entirely from a design file. LA Mountains is meant to be a pixel perfect translation of a PSD file into a fully working website.

Key points:

1. Features a fully functional "No Javascript" tab section that collapses into an accordion on mobile
2. All the images where extracted directly from the PSD and optimized for the web.
3. Fonts matching those in the PSD are imported from google fonts and used in the website
4. Features a fully functional slide show created through the Swiper.js library
5. Completely mobile responsive
